## Analyze Box Office Data with Plotly and Seaborn

This is a project for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly and Seaborn. The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction dataset has been used for the task.  

The motion picture industry is generating more revenue than ever with its expansive growth all over the world.  
- Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue? 
- Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue?   

One way to answer these questions would be to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  and feature engineering. I have used the statistical data visualization libraries, Seaborn and Plotly, to apply graphical techniques used in EDA.
